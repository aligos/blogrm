# React Meteor Template

This is a boilerplate template for a Meteor.js app that uses React.js as the view layer

## NOTE

The first time you run this app it will fail. This is because it is using the reywood:bootstrap3-sass package. If you restart the app after it crashes it will then work from that point on. Check out the "To use" section [here](https://atmospherejs.com/reywood/bootstrap3-sass) for more info.

## Install

Run the following to get the bash file to work:

```
chmod +x ./run.sh
```

Now you can start the app with the following command:

```
./run.sh
```
